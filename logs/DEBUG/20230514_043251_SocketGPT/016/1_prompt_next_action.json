IP addresses are used to identify devices on a network, while ports are used to identify specific applications or services running on those devices. When data is transmitted between devices on a network, it is routed based on the destination IP address and port number. For example, when a web browser requests a web page from a web server, it sends a request to the server's IP address on port 80 (or 443 for HTTPS). The server then responds to the request by sending the requested web page back to the browser's IP address on a random port number. This process of identifying devices and services using IP addresses and ports is essential for enabling communication between devices on a network, and is a fundamental concept in network socket communication.\"\n        }\n    }\n}"

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that it establishes a reliable connection between two devices before transmitting data. This ensures that all data is transmitted in the correct order and that no data is lost or corrupted during transmission. UDP, on the other hand, is a connectionless protocol, which means that it does not establish a reliable connection before transmitting data. This makes UDP faster and more efficient than TCP, but also less reliable. UDP is often used for transmitting non-critical data, such as video and audio streams, while TCP is used for transmitting critical data, such as financial transactions and email messages. Overall, the choice between TCP and UDP depends on the specific needs of the application or service being used, and both protocols have their advantages and disadvantages.\"\n        }\n    }\n}"
