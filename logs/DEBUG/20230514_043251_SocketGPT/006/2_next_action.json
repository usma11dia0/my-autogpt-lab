TCP is a reliable protocol that ensures data is transmitted correctly and in order, while UDP is a faster protocol that sacrifices reliability for speed. Commonly used ports include port 80 for web browsing, port 25 for email, and port 443 for secure web browsing. Network socket communication is used in a variety of real-world scenarios, including online gaming, web browsing, and email."
