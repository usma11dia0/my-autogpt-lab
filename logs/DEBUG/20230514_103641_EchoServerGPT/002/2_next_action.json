        "text": "Now that we have created a new Python file to write our echo server code in, we can start writing the code step by step with detailed comments to make it easy for high school students to understand. The first step is to import the socket module, which will allow us to create a socket object. We can then create a socket object using the socket() method, passing in the socket family and socket type as arguments. We can then get the local machine name using the gethostname() method, and bind the socket to the port using the bind() method. Finally, we can start listening on the socket using the listen() method.",
        "reasoning": "Importing the socket module will allow us to create a socket object, which is necessary for creating a server. Creating a socket object using the socket() method will allow us to specify the socket family and socket type. Getting the local machine name using the gethostname() method will allow us to bind the socket to the correct IP address. Binding the socket to the port using the bind() method will allow us to listen for incoming connections on that port. Starting to listen on the socket using the listen() method will allow us to accept incoming connections.",
