            "text": "\n\nNetwork Socket Communication in Web Browsing\n\nNetwork socket communication is used extensively in web browsing to transmit data between web servers and web browsers. This includes information such as web page content, images, and videos. In order to transmit this data, web browsers use a variety of protocols, including HTTP and HTTPS. HTTP is used for transmitting non-secure data, such as web page content, while HTTPS is used for transmitting secure data, such as login credentials and payment information. In addition to HTTP and HTTPS, web browsers may also use other protocols, such as FTP, for downloading files from web servers. Overall, network socket communication is a critical component of web browsing, and is essential for providing a seamless and secure browsing experience for users."
