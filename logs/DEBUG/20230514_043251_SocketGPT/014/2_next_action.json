            "text": "IP Addresses and Ports in Network Socket Communication\n\nIP addresses and ports are two critical components of network socket communication. IP addresses are used to identify devices on a network, while ports are used to identify specific applications or services running on those devices. When data is transmitted between devices on a network, it is routed based on the destination IP address and port number. For example, when a web browser requests a web page from a web server, it sends a request to the server's IP address on port 80 (or 443 for HTTPS). The server then responds to the request by sending the requested web page back to the browser's IP address on a random port number. This process of identifying devices and services using IP addresses and ports is essential for enabling communication between devices on a network, and is a fundamental concept in network socket communication."
