You then give the envelope to the post office, which sends it to your friend's address. Your friend receives the letter, opens the envelope, and reads the contents. In network socket communication, your program is like the person writing the letter, the socket is like the envelope, and the network is like the post office. Your program puts data into the socket, which is then sent over the network to the destination socket. The destination program then reads the data from the socket, just like your friend reads the contents of the letter."
