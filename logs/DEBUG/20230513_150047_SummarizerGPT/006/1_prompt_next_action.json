There are over 7,500 cultivars of apples, which are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Apples are prone to fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. China is the largest producer of apples in the world. Apples are often eaten raw and are an important ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie and apple cake. They can also be canned, dried, or frozen. Apples are associated with various cultural traditions and mythologies, such as the story of Adam and Eve in the Bible. Apples are a good source of fiber and vitamin C, and may have health benefits such as reducing the risk of certain types of cancer. Some people may be allergic to apples, and the seeds contain a small amount of cyanide which can be toxic in large quantities. \\n \\n Links: ['Jump to content (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#bodyContent)', 'Main page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)', 'Contents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents)', 'Current events (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events)', 'Random article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random)']\", <selenium.webdriver.chrome.webdriver.WebDriver (session=\"c202034ab0f4ee59562178f85f167563\")>)"
