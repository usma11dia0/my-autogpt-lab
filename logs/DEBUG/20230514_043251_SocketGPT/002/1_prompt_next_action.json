Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\n\nGOALS:\n\n1. Generate clear and concise descriptions of network socket communication concepts, including IP addresses, ports, and protocols, in a language that high school students can easily comprehend.\n2. Provide examples and analogies to help students visualize and understand how network socket communication works.\n3. Use engaging and interactive language to keep students interested and motivated to learn more about network socket communication.\n4. Ensure that all descriptions are accurate and technically correct, while still being accessible to high school students.\n5. Output all descriptions in a single txt file format for easy distribution and accessibility.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.\n2. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.\n3. No user assistance\n4. Exclusively use the commands listed in double quotes e.g. \"command name\"\n\nCommands:\n1. analyze_code: Analyze Code, args: \"code\": \"<full_code_string>\"\n2. execute_python_file: Execute Python File, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\"\n3. append_to_file: Append to file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"text\": \"<text>\"\n4. delete_file: Delete file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\"\n5. list_files: List Files in Directory, args: \"directory\": \"<directory>\"\n6. read_file: Read file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\"\n7. write_to_file: Write to file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"text\": \"<text>\"\n8. improve_code: Get Improved Code, args: \"suggestions\": \"<list_of_suggestions>\", \"code\": \"<full_code_string>\"\n9. send_tweet: Send Tweet, args: \"tweet_text\": \"<tweet_text>\"\n10. browse_website: Browse Website, args: \"url\": \"<url>\", \"question\": \"<what_you_want_to_find_on_website>\"\n11. write_tests: Write Tests, args: \"code\": \"<full_code_string>\", \"focus\": \"<list_of_focus_areas>\"\n12. delete_agent: Delete GPT Agent, args: \"key\": \"<key>\"\n13. get_hyperlinks: Get text summary, args: \"url\": \"<url>\"\n14. get_text_summary: Get text summary, args: \"url\": \"<url>\", \"question\": \"<question>\"\n15. list_agents: List GPT Agents, args: () -> str\n16. message_agent: Message GPT Agent, args: \"key\": \"<key>\", \"message\": \"<message>\"\n17. start_agent: Start GPT Agent, args: \"name\": \"<name>\", \"task\": \"<short_task_desc>\", \"prompt\": \"<prompt>\"\n18. Task Complete (Shutdown): \"task_complete\", args: \"reason\": \"<reason>\"\n\nResources:\n1. Internet access for searches and information gathering.\n2. Long Term memory management.\n3. GPT-3.5 powered Agents for delegation of simple tasks.\n4. File output.\n\nPerformance Evaluation:\n1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities.\n2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behavior constantly.\n3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.\n4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps.\n5. Write all code to a file.\n\nYou should only respond in JSON format as described below \nResponse Format: \n{\n    \"thoughts\": {\n        \"text\": \"thought\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"reasoning\",\n        \"plan\": \"- short bulleted\\n- list that conveys\\n- long-term plan\",\n        \"criticism\": \"constructive self-criticism\",\n        \"speak\": \"thoughts summary to say to user\"\n    },\n    \"command\": {\n        \"name\": \"command name\",\n        \"args\": {\n            \"arg name\": \"value\"\n        }\n    }\n} \nEnsure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads"

It involves the use of IP addresses, ports, and protocols to establish a connection and exchange data.\\n\\nAn IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. It is used to identify the source and destination of data being transmitted.\\n\\nA port is a number used to identify a specific process or application running on a device. It is used in conjunction with an IP address to establish a connection and exchange data.\\n\\nProtocols are a set of rules and standards that govern the exchange of data between devices. Examples of protocols include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).\\n\\nIn summary, network socket communication involves the use of IP addresses, ports, and protocols to establish a connection and exchange data between two devices on a network.\"\n        }\n    }\n}"
