            "text": "\n\nNetwork Socket Communication in Email\n\nNetwork socket communication is used extensively in email to transmit data between email clients and email servers. This includes information such as email messages, attachments, and metadata. In order to transmit this data, email clients and servers use a variety of protocols, including SMTP, POP3, and IMAP. SMTP is used for transmitting outgoing email messages, while POP3 and IMAP are used for retrieving incoming email messages. In addition to SMTP, POP3, and IMAP, email clients and servers may also use other protocols, such as HTTP and HTTPS, for transmitting data related to email updates and patches. Overall, network socket communication is a critical component of email, and is essential for providing a reliable and efficient email experience for users."
