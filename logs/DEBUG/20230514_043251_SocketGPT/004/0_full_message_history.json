When you visit a website, your computer sends a request to the website's server using the server's IP address and a specific port. The server then responds with the requested information, which is received by your computer using the same IP address and port.\\n\\nIn summary, network socket communication can be visualized using analogies such as sending a letter or having a telephone conversation.

It is a 32-bit number, typically represented in dotted decimal notation (e.g. 192.168.0.1). IP addresses are used to identify the source and destination of data being transmitted. There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses are the most common and consist of four sets of numbers separated by periods. IPv6 addresses are newer and consist of eight sets of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons.\\n\\nPorts\\n\\nA port is a number used to identify a specific process or application running on a device. It is used in conjunction with an IP address to establish a connection and exchange data. There are 65,535 available ports, with the first 1,024 reserved for specific applications and protocols. Commonly used ports include port 80 for HTTP (web browsing), port 25 for SMTP (email), and port 443 for HTTPS (secure web browsing).\\n\\nProtocols\\n\\nProtocols are a set of rules and standards that govern the exchange of data between devices. They define how data is formatted, transmitted, and received. There are many different protocols used in network socket communication, but some of the most common include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). TCP is a reliable protocol that ensures all data is transmitted and received in the correct order. UDP is a faster protocol that does not guarantee all data will be transmitted or received, but is useful for applications where speed is more important than accuracy.\\n\\nIn summary, IP addresses are unique identifiers used to identify the source and destination of data being transmitted. Ports are numbers used to identify specific processes or applications running on a device. Protocols are a set of rules and standards that govern the exchange of data between devices.\"\n        }\n    }\n}"
