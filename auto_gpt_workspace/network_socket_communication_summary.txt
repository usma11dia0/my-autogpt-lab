- IP addresses are unique identifiers that allow computers to communicate with each other over a network.

- Ports are used to identify specific applications or services running on a computer.

- TCP is a reliable protocol that ensures data is transmitted correctly and in order, while UDP is a faster protocol that sacrifices reliability for speed.

- Commonly used ports include port 80 for web browsing, port 25 for email, and port 443 for secure web browsing.

- Network socket communication is used in a variety of real-world scenarios, including online gaming, web browsing, and email.
