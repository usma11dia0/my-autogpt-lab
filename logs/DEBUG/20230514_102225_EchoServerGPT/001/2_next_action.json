        "text": "I suggest we start by creating a new Python file to write our echo server code in. We can then proceed to write the code step by step, ensuring that we include detailed comments for each line to make it easy for high school students to understand. We should also implement error handling to ensure that the server does not crash or behave unexpectedly when faced with unexpected inputs or errors. Finally, we can optimize the code for efficiency and readability, and provide additional resources and support to users who may have questions or need further assistance in creating their own echo server.",
        "reasoning": "Creating a new Python file will allow us to write our code in an organized and structured manner. Writing the code step by step with detailed comments will make it easy for high school students to understand. Implementing error handling will ensure that the server does not crash or behave unexpectedly when faced with unexpected inputs or errors. Optimizing the code for efficiency and readability will make it easy to maintain and modify in the future. Providing additional resources and support will ensure that users have all the help they need to create their own echo server.",
