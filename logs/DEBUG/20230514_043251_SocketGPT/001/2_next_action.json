            "text": "Network Socket Communication Overview\n\nNetwork socket communication is a method of communication between two devices over a network. It involves the use of IP addresses, ports, and protocols to establish a connection and exchange data.\n\nAn IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. It is used to identify the source and destination of data being transmitted.\n\nA port is a number used to identify a specific process or application running on a device. It is used in conjunction with an IP address to establish a connection and exchange data.\n\nProtocols are a set of rules and standards that govern the exchange of data between devices. Examples of protocols include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).\n\nIn summary, network socket communication involves the use of IP addresses, ports, and protocols to establish a connection and exchange data between two devices on a network."
