        "text": "I suggest we start by creating a new Python file to write our echo server code in. We can then begin by importing the necessary modules and defining the server's IP address and port number. Once we have done that, we can create a socket object and bind it to the IP address and port number. Finally, we can listen for incoming connections and handle them by receiving data from the client and echoing it back.",
