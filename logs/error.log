When you send a message in a chat application, your message is sent over the network to the other person's device using network socket communication. The chat application on your device creates a socket and sends the message data over the socket to the chat application on the other person's device. The chat application on the other person's device receives the message data from the socket and displays it to the user. This process happens in real-time, allowing you to have a conversation with someone even if they are on the other side of the world.",

The IP address identifies the device on the network, while the port number identifies the specific application running on the device. When two programs want to communicate with each other over a network, they each create a socket and connect to each other's socket. Once the connection is established, the programs can send and receive data over the network using the sockets. The data is broken up into packets and sent over the network, with each packet containing a portion of the data along with information about where it came from and where it is going. The packets are reassembled at the destination into the original data.",
