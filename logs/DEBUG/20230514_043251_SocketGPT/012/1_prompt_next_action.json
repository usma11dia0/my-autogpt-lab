TCP is used for transmitting critical data, such as player movements and actions, while UDP is used for transmitting non-critical data, such as chat messages. In addition to TCP and UDP, online games may also use other protocols, such as HTTP and HTTPS, for transmitting data related to game updates and patches. Overall, network socket communication is a critical component of online gaming, and is essential for providing a seamless and immersive gaming experience for players.\"\n        }\n    }\n}"
