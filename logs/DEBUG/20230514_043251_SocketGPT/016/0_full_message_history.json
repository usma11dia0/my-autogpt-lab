It is a 32-bit number, typically represented in dotted decimal notation (e.g. 192.168.0.1). IP addresses are used to identify the source and destination of data being transmitted. There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses are the most common and consist of four sets of numbers separated by periods. IPv6 addresses are newer and consist of eight sets of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons.\\n\\nPorts\\n\\nA port is a number used to identify a specific process or application running on a device. It is used in conjunction with an IP address to establish a connection and exchange data. There are 65,535 available ports, with the first 1,024 reserved for specific applications and protocols. Commonly used ports include port 80 for HTTP (web browsing), port 25 for SMTP (email), and port 443 for HTTPS (secure web browsing).\\n\\nProtocols\\n\\nProtocols are a set of rules and standards that govern the exchange of data between devices. They define how data is formatted, transmitted, and received. There are many different protocols used in network socket communication, but some of the most common include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). TCP is a reliable protocol that ensures all data is transmitted and received in the correct order. UDP is a faster protocol that does not guarantee all data will be transmitted or received, but is useful for applications where speed is more important than accuracy.\\n\\nIn summary, IP addresses are unique identifiers used to identify the source and destination of data being transmitted. Ports are numbers used to identify specific processes or applications running on a device. Protocols are a set of rules and standards that govern the exchange of data between devices.\"\n        }\n    }\n}"

IP addresses are used to identify devices on a network, while ports are used to identify specific applications or services running on those devices. When data is transmitted between devices on a network, it is routed based on the destination IP address and port number. For example, when a web browser requests a web page from a web server, it sends a request to the server's IP address on port 80 (or 443 for HTTPS). The server then responds to the request by sending the requested web page back to the browser's IP address on a random port number. This process of identifying devices and services using IP addresses and ports is essential for enabling communication between devices on a network, and is a fundamental concept in network socket communication.\"\n        }\n    }\n}"

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that it establishes a reliable connection between two devices before transmitting data. This ensures that all data is transmitted in the correct order and that no data is lost or corrupted during transmission. UDP, on the other hand, is a connectionless protocol, which means that it does not establish a reliable connection before transmitting data. This makes UDP faster and more efficient than TCP, but also less reliable. UDP is often used for transmitting non-critical data, such as video and audio streams, while TCP is used for transmitting critical data, such as financial transactions and email messages. Overall, the choice between TCP and UDP depends on the specific needs of the application or service being used, and both protocols have their advantages and disadvantages.\"\n        }\n    }\n}"
