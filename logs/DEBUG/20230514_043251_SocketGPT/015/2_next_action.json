            "text": "TCP vs. UDP in Network Socket Communication\n\nTCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two of the most commonly used protocols in network socket communication. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that it establishes a reliable connection between two devices before transmitting data. This ensures that all data is transmitted in the correct order and that no data is lost or corrupted during transmission. UDP, on the other hand, is a connectionless protocol, which means that it does not establish a reliable connection before transmitting data. This makes UDP faster and more efficient than TCP, but also less reliable. UDP is often used for transmitting non-critical data, such as video and audio streams, while TCP is used for transmitting critical data, such as financial transactions and email messages. Overall, the choice between TCP and UDP depends on the specific needs of the application or service being used, and both protocols have their advantages and disadvantages."
